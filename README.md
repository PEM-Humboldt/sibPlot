# sib_plot

sib_plot is a project consisting in creating database formats and utilities for plant plot data in SiB Colombia (Sistema de Informaci√≥n sobre la Biodiversidad de Colombia).

This repository is a first test made by Marius Bottin.
During the following weeks, the repository will be deleted and replaced by another one hosted by Roy Gonzalez, who made the first efforts in writing some R code and thinking about the relational database format.
Since we are not very Git/GitHub fluent, I make this first repository as a test, but the real deal is coming soon!
